 * Fallback price adapter to unconditionally return 0 on all input addresses.
 * This adapter can be used as a last-resort to default to a token price of 0
 * in case all other adapters fail to resolve a token price.
 *
 * Note: This adapter could be augmented to permit returning a custom price on a per-token bsis.
 * This would allow the caller to peg token prices, which has been a use cases in the Across API.
 * That's left as an open possibility for now.
